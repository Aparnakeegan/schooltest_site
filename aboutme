  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Aparna Keegan, a Public Health Specialty  Doctor currently based in Ireland. I hold an MB ChB from the University of Manchester and an MSc in Global Health Science from the University of Oxford. With experience across public health policy, epidemiological research, and maternal health, I’ve led national and international projects including HIV policy advisory roles, public health strategy development, and programme evaluations in humanitarian settings. I’m passionate about data-driven health interventions and improving outcomes at both individual and population levels. My current interests include data visualisation, interactive dashboards, and using analytics for strategic planning.</p>
