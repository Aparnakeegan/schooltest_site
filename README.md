aboutme
Hi, I’m **Aparnareddy Keegan**, currently working as a Public Health Doctor in Ireland. I earned my MB ChB from the University of Manchester and later completed an MSc in Global Health Science at the University of Oxford, where I also served as Graduate International Students Officer.

I’ve led diverse public health initiatives, from developing a national breastfeeding decision aid to evaluating large-scale development programmes and influencing HIV policy at the international level. My recent work focuses on strategic planning, data-driven interventions, and improving care for vulnerable populations. I’m particularly interested in using data analytics and visualisation to support impactful decision-making in health systems.
